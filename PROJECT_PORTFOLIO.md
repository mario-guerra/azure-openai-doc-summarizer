# Azure OpenAI Document Summarizer - Portfolio Project

## Description

The Azure OpenAI Document Summarizer is an intelligent document processing solution that leverages Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service to automatically generate comprehensive summaries of large documents. This tool addresses the critical business challenge of information overload by transforming lengthy documents, PDFs, Word files, and web content into actionable, digestible summaries.

The solution implements an innovative "sliding content window" algorithm that enables processing of documents of any size while maintaining contextual coherence throughout the summarization process. This approach ensures that important information isn't lost when dealing with documents that exceed typical AI model token limits.

## Problem Solved

**Primary Challenge:** Information overload in document-heavy business environments where employees and decision-makers struggle to efficiently process large volumes of textual content.

**Specific Issues Addressed:**
1. **Time Inefficiency** - Manual document review consuming hours of valuable employee time
2. **Inconsistent Analysis** - Varying quality and depth of manual summaries between different reviewers
3. **Scale Limitations** - Inability to process multiple large documents simultaneously
4. **Context Loss** - Traditional chunking methods losing important cross-references and contextual relationships
5. **Format Diversity** - Need to process various document types from different sources
6. **Audience Customization** - Requirement for different summary styles for executives, technical teams, and operational staff
